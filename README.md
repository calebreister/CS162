CS162
=====

This is all of my work in CS162. I have extended my capabilities greatly.

libjson (aka JSON++) can be found at https://bitbucket.org/tunnuz/json/src
I used a tool called git-hg to import it as a Git repo and set it as a submodule.

This game runs on SFML 2.1.

Built under Ubuntu 13.10 64 bit.
